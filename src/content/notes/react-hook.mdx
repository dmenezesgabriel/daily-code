Just jotting down some thoughts on React Hooks. They're like magic beans for your components!

## useState: The Seed of State

- Plant a piece of state, watch it grow
- Water it with `setState`, see your UI flourish

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
// Look ma, I'm stateful!
```

## useEffect: The Sunlight of Side Effects

- Shine some light on your component lifecycle
- Perfect for data fetching, subscriptions, and more

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
}, [count]); // Only re-run the effect if count changes
```

More to come as this garden grows! ğŸŒ»
